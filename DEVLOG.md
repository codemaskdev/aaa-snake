# AAA Snake: DEVLOG

What was done, what broke, the real numbers, and what actually happened in each session. Numbers come from
`npm run measure` (measurements/) and are never rounded here.

## 2026-10-14 — Prompt 1: setup, Snake v1.0, the measuring rig, the short recorder, the update plan

Commits: bf750bb (rules and logs), b107036 (Snake v1.0, tag v1.0), b685f9e (rig, chart, v1.0 measured),
a919bfc (UPDATES.md proposal), 30d0713 (chart labels), 321cb33 (short recorder), aea276d (replay fix).
No update was built; UPDATES.md waits for approval.

### What was built
- **Snake v1.0**: src/rules.js (96 lines: grid, seeded generator, moves, apples; no screen, keys or clock) and
  src/game.js (144 lines: keys, fixed 100 ms tick, drawing, and a read-only probe for the bot), plus index.html
  (20 lines). Built to dist/v1.0/ and tagged v1.0.
- **The rig** (`npm run measure`): a bot plays seed 1 five times in Chromium's new headless mode, then five times in a
  visible window for frame rate. Raw runs, medians and the command output are in measurements/.
- **`npm run fps-check`**, **`npm run chart`** (out/bloat.png), **`npm run short`** (out/shorts/<version>/).
- 47 tests (`npm test`), including the rig against a fixture page with known timings (tests/fixture).

### Dependencies
- playwright 1.63.0 (dev), exact pin. Reason: the headless browser for the rig, the chart and the short recorder.
  1.64.0 was out, but it was one week old; 1.63.0 was the newest release more than two weeks old. It brings
  Chromium 153.0.8010.12.
- ffmpeg 8.1.1 (system tool, not pinned by npm) encodes the shorts; each clip.json records its version.

### v1.0, measured (`npm run measure v1.0`, medians of 5 runs, measurements/v1.0.json)
- Time to first apple: 320.6000000089407 ms (run 1). Screens on the way: (page load) 16.400000005960464 ms, ready
  15.299999997019768 ms, play 288.90000000596046 ms.
- Load time (first frame that accepts input): 26 ms.
- Control share: 0.9998805555555556 of 180000 ms.
- JS heap (CDP Runtime.getHeapUsage usedSize, after a forced GC, at 60 s of control): 929680 bytes.
- Download: 9423 bytes in 3 requests. JS: 240 lines, 8130 bytes. Code (JS + HTML): 260 lines. Assets: 0 bytes.
- Frame rate in a visible window: median 60 fps, 5th percentile 56.81818181818064 fps. Budget: pass.
- Checks: first apple on tick 3 in all 5 runs; 1125 of 1125 turns accepted; 0 external requests; 0 page errors.

### What broke
- **The bot pressed before anything was on screen.** In the first trial run the bot saw the `ready` screen in the
  game's state and pressed a key before the first frame had been drawn, and the first frame then came late. A player
  can't react to a screen they haven't seen, so the probe got a `shown` flag and the bot now acts only on drawn
  screens. (Trial runs before the rig was finished are not saved, so their numbers are not quoted here.)
- **Headless WebGL ran in software.** Playwright's default headless shell draws WebGL with SwiftShader, not the M1's
  GPU. In `npm run fps-check` (measurements/fps-check-output.txt), the light WebGL load ran at a median of 6 fps in the
  headless shell and 60 fps in a visible window. The rig now uses Chromium's new headless mode (Playwright channel
  "chromium"), which draws with ANGLE Metal on the M1.
- **Even on the GPU, headless frame rate is not the visible window's.** Same check: medians agree on CPU work (40 and
  40 fps) and light WebGL (60 and 60), but not on heavy WebGL (18 headless, 20.5 visible), and the 5th percentile is
  higher headless (59.88023952095548 vs 56.49717514124642 fps with no load). So frame rate is measured in a visible
  window, and the headless figure is kept next to it in every measurement file.
- **The frame-rate median jumped.** rAF timestamps snap to the 60 Hz display, so a frame that takes 25 ms shows up as
  16.7 ms and 33.3 ms intervals in turn. A per-frame median then lands on 60, 30, or the mean of the two. A test run
  failed with: `fps 44.77691977691978 with 25 ms of work per frame`. The median is now taken over per-second frame
  counts (an FPS counter), which reads 40 on that load in every mode; the 5th percentile stays per frame to catch
  stutter.
- **The short's first frame was a title card.** It was captured right after the bot's first key, before the game had
  redrawn, so it still said "Press an arrow key or WASD". Clips now start on the first frame drawn after the key.
- **The replay lost a key.** The recorder replayed the bot's keys at their recorded times. On the fixture, the logo's
  timer starts on the first frame, which comes a few ms later in the replay than in the run, so the bot's Escape landed
  while the logo was still up and was ignored: `Error: the replayed first apple (null ms) is more than 50 ms from the
  median (1846.8999999910593 ms)`. Each key now also waits for the screen and tick it was pressed on. v1.0's short was
  re-recorded after the fix: same 8 apples as the recorded run, first apple 3.933333342274011 ms before the median.
- **The chart said "100.0 %".** Control share 0.9998805555555556 rounded to one decimal looked like a perfect score.
  It now shows two decimals, and labels near the top of a panel drop below the point instead of hitting the title.
- **My own tests, four times:** vm-sandbox arrays failed `deepEqual` against arrays from the test's realm; a counter
  test expected `61.2345` to round up and floating point disagreed; a test expected 2 runs after I changed the run to 3;
  and the determinism test failed on the game's own comment, which says it never uses Math.random:
  `AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: src/rules.js uses Math.random`. Comments are now stripped before that check.
- **favicon.ico.** The visible window asked for /favicon.ico and logged a 404 as a page error; index.html now declares
  an empty icon.

### Surprising, as it happened
- All 5 headless runs of v1.0 played the same game: first apple on tick 3, 225 turns sent and 225 accepted, exactly
  1 death in 3 minutes, in every run.
- With seed 1 the first apple is 3 cells straight ahead of the snake, so the bot's fastest path is to press Right, the
  way the snake is already heading, and wait.
- Before garbage collection the heap read 7387072, 6553656, 6607940, 6459580 and 6302320 bytes; after it, 929660 to
  930284.

### Not tested
- How v1.0 feels in human hands: all play so far was the bot and one scripted test.
- Frame rate in the visible window assumes the window stays on screen (the rig disables Chromium's background
  throttling, but a minimized window was not tried).

🎬 Maybe: "Time to first apple: 0.321 s." The number every later short is measured against.
